**# TEXT-EDITOR-PROJECT**
**Project Description**
In this project, we will create a simple text editor with a menu bar that contains two menus: File and Edit. The File menu will allow users to create new text files, open existing files, and save files to disk. The Edit menu will provide options for copying, cutting, and pasting text.

The File menu will have the following options:

New: This option will create a new blank file that the user can edit.

Open: This option will allow the user to select an existing text file from the file system and open it for editing.

Save: This option will save the contents of the currently open file to disk.

Exit: This option will exit the application.

The Edit menu will have the following options:

Cut: This option will cut the currently selected text and place it in the clipboard.

Copy: This option will copy the currently selected text to the clipboard.

Paste: This option will insert the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor position.
