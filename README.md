# TEXT-EDITOR-PROJECT
In this project, we will create a simple text editor with a menu bar that contains two menus: File and Edit. The File menu will allow users to create new text files, open existing files, and save files to disk. The Edit menu will provide options for copying, cutting, and pasting text.
